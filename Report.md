1. Introduction
As software systems grow in complexity, the need for effective debugging tools becomes increasingly critical. Traditional debugging methods often fall short in providing timely and accurate solutions to coding errors. This report presents an AI-based code debugger that utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze code and suggest potential fixes. By automating the debugging process, developers can save time and reduce the likelihood of introducing new errors.

2. Background and Motivation
2.1. Challenges of Traditional Debugging
Traditional debugging techniques face several challenges:

Manual Inspection: Developers often spend significant time manually inspecting code to identify errors.
Trial and Error: Debugging frequently involves a trial-and-error approach, which can lead to frustration and inefficiency.
Lack of Context: Traditional tools may not provide sufficient context or suggestions for resolving issues.
2.2. Why AI for Debugging?
AI offers several advantages for debugging:

Pattern Recognition: Machine learning models can identify patterns in code and error messages that may not be immediately apparent to developers.
Automated Suggestions: AI can provide real-time suggestions and potential fixes based on historical data and learned patterns.
Continuous Learning: AI systems can improve over time by learning from new code samples and debugging scenarios.
3. System Architecture and Project Structure
3.1. Overview of the Project
The AI-based code debugger consists of several key components:

Data Preparation: Loading and preprocessing code samples, extracting relevant features.
Model Definition: Building a machine learning model to analyze code and generate suggestions.
Training: Training the model on historical debugging data.
Interactive Inference: Allowing users to input code snippets and receive debugging suggestions.
3.2. Directory Structure and Components

4. Data Preparation and Feature Extraction
4.1. Dataset Overview
The dataset (code_samples.csv) contains key columns:

code_snippet: The code sample that may contain errors.
error_message: The associated error message generated during execution.
suggested_fix: Suggested fixes for the identified errors.
4.2. Loading and Preprocessing Code Samples
Using the Pandas library, the CSV file is read into a DataFrame. This allows for easy extraction and manipulation of necessary columns for further processing.

4.3. Feature Engineering
Feature extraction involves:

Tokenization: Breaking down code snippets into tokens for analysis.
Vectorization: Converting tokens into numerical representations using techniques such as TF-IDF or word embeddings.
Error Context: Including error messages as additional features to provide context for the model.
5. AI Model Design
5.1. Theoretical Underpinnings of Machine Learning
Machine learning models can learn from historical data to make predictions or suggestions. In this case, the model learns to associate code patterns with specific error messages and suggested fixes.

5.2. Architecture of the Debugger Model
The core model is implemented in the debugger_model.py file. The architecture includes:

Input Layer: Accepts tokenized and vectorized code snippets.
Hidden Layers: Comprises several dense layers with activation functions to learn complex patterns.
Output Layer: Produces suggestions for code fixes based on learned representations.
5.3. Hyperparameter Choices and Design Considerations
Input Dimension: Based on the size of the vectorized code snippets.
Hidden Layers: Number of layers and units per layer determined through empirical evaluation.
Learning Rate: Set to 0.001 for the Adam optimizer.
6. Training Methodology
6.1. Data Splitting and Sampling
The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate model performance.

6.2. Loss Computation and Optimization Strategy
The loss function is computed based on the difference between predicted and actual suggestions. The Adam optimizer is used to minimize this loss.

6.3. Training Process and Convergence Monitoring
During training, the model's performance is monitored using validation data, and early stopping is implemented to prevent overfitting.

7. Interactive Debugging and Inference
7.1. User Query Processing
Users can input code snippets, which are preprocessed and tokenized for analysis.

7.2. Suggestion Generation and Code Fixes
The model generates suggestions based on the input code and associated error messages.

7.3. User Interaction Flow
The user is provided with a command-line interface:

The system prompts for a code snippet.
Suggestions are printed to the console.
Typing “quit” exits the interactive session.
